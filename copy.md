## 2. The Pilgrimage

### Section Header Options

- "Where the earth remembers"
- "Ancient ground, living wisdom"

### Body

This is not a vacation. This is a pilgrimage — a devotion to the sacred places that have held ceremony, prayer, and healing for thousands of years.

From the temples of Egypt to ancient lands still waiting to be named, each site carries a frequency. A vibration. A message that can only be received by those who arrive with an open heart.

I am going. And I want you to feel it with me.

## 3. What Subscribers Experience

### Section Header

"Inside the sacred circle"

### Body

- **Unfiltered ceremony** — Raw, intimate moments from rituals and sacred practices at each site
- **Transmissions from the land** — My reflections, downloads, and channeled insights as I walk the ancient paths
- **Behind the veil** — The preparation, the silence before ceremony, the moments between — what you never see on a public feed

## 4. Join In Person

### Section Header Options

- "Some paths are meant to be walked together"
- "Step onto the land yourself"

### Body

On select pilgrimages, a small number of souls will be invited to walk alongside me. To stand on the sacred ground. To participate in ceremony. To feel the earth beneath your feet, not through a screen.

These are intimate gatherings — limited by intention, not by numbers.

If this calls to you, subscribing is the first step. All in-person journey invitations are shared inside the circle first.
