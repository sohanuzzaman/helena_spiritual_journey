        We have been taught that consciousness is a product of the brain — a
        mechanical spark born from matter. But the ancient builders knew
        differently. They understood that awareness is a signal, downloaded from
        the ether, received through the plasma field that connects all living
        things.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sacred sites are not monuments to the past. They are antennae —
        nodes in a living network that still transmits. When you stand inside a
        temple, a cave, a stone circle, your body becomes a crystal tuning fork,
        vibrating in resonance with frequencies the modern world has forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        This pilgrimage is not about visiting places. It is about remembering
        how to receive.
