        This is not a vacation. This is a pilgrimage — a devotion to the sacred places that have held ceremony, prayer, and healing for thousands of years.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the temples of Egypt to ancient lands still waiting to be named, each site carries a frequency. A vibration. A message that can only be received by those who arrive with an open heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am going. And I want you to feel it with me.
